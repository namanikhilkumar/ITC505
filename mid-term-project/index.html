            <h3>Addendum</h3>
            <p>The development of the "The Baahubali Game: Choose Your Adventure" interactive story began with an extensive planning phase where  I have created a flowchart to map out the various story segments and there will be some choices available to the player to choose . I have visualy  represented and this helped me to ensure that the narrative felt cohesive and engaging, allowing for a rich user experience.</p>
            <p>Each story is divided into the key themes from the "Baahubali" saga, emphasizing bravery, destiny, and the consequences of choices. I have created a balance between storytelling and player to play the game like story which creats a good impact</p>
            <h4>Challenges Faced</h4>
            <p>Through out the creation of this game i have faced the challenges like structuring the story naration. as there are multiple endings in the game i have faced a challenge in doing it in a great manner i needed to carefully map out each choice's consequences to maintain logical flow and avoid dead ends. To overcome this, I developed a detailed outline of the story paths, so that it allows me to visualize connections and transitions between segments.</p>
            <p>Additionally, I have mainly faced a challenge in selecting the images which reflect the correct story. I wanted each image to resonate with the story's tone and context. I have spent lot of  time selecting the correct images that would elevate the storytelling and engaged players more deeply.</p>
            <h4>Insights Gained</h4>
            <p>Throughout this project, I learned the importance of player agency in interactive storytelling. Observing how different choices lead to different  outcomes deepened my understanding of narrative design. This experience taught me that even seemingly minor decisions can significantly affect the player's emotional connection to the story.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, I realized the value of user interface design in creating an immersive experience. By implementing visually appealing buttons and responsive design elements, I was able to enhance the overall user experience, encouraging players to explore different paths and endings.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, this project not only strengthened my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript but also deepened my knowledge in narrative structure and player engagement in a interactive way.</p>
